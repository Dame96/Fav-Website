# Fav-Website


-->

Hi Team! Welcome to the my favorite website...with a twist. For this project's inspiration I chose to emulate and modify the world famous luxury car brand mercedes website.  I have been a fan on this prestigous brand for the innovative designs and technological advances that they have contributed to the industry for many years. 

In this project I utilized Bootstraps stylying, utility classes, and components to ensure that my layout is modern, appealing and responsive on all devices.

On the home page I implemented an accordion component under the banner image to list some fun facts about the brand I call "fanatic facts".
For the vehicles page I used the Bootstrap table component to display in my opinion what are the premier vehicles of 2025 along with the horsepower and price of each. 
Lastly, on the contact form I implemented a form with input fields to collect customer information to reach out and inquire about vehicles along with a card component previewing concept cars! 

I also included some JavaScript functions! ( not currently active but this is how they will work once completed.)

function #1 generates a pop-up alert that greets the user on the homepage. 
function #2 validates the form to ensure that the user doesn't leave the field empty. 
function #3 changes the background of the contact page when the "add me to the list button" is clicked 
function #4 play the sound of a mercedes engine when the carouses slides to the next image. 

Enjoy!
